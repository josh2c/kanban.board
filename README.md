Kanban Board Project
Overview

This is a Kanban board web application that allows users to manage tasks in different columns such as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". The project incorporates features such as drag-and-drop functionality, customizable task cards, and a sidebar for navigation. The board is styled with a modern, responsive design inspired by popular tools like Jira.
Features

    Drag and Drop: Tasks can be dragged between columns, making task management intuitive.
    Responsive Design: The board adjusts to different screen sizes, making it usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
    Sidebar Menu: Provides quick access to Kanban board features, including the backlog, home, and other areas.
    Task Styling: Each task card has a distinct color to indicate its status or priority. Task cards are interactive and hoverable for a more dynamic user experience.

Next Steps and Future Improvements

Sign-in and Authentication: Implement a sign-in feature so users can create accounts and log in to their personalized Kanban boards. This will allow users to access their boards securely and from different devices.
Task Persistence: Implement a way to save tasks and their locations (columns). This will prevent data loss and ensure usersâ€™ tasks are saved even when they refresh or close the page. This could be achieved by using localStorage, sessionStorage, or a backend database.
 Backend Integration: Add server-side logic to store user data and tasks. This could include using a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) to persist tasks, users, and board states.
    User Interface Enhancements: Improve the UI by adding more interactivity, such as task filters, search functionality, and due dates for tasks.
    Task Deadline & Reminders: Add due dates to tasks and set up notifications or reminders when a task is approaching its deadline.
    Task Prioritization: Allow users to prioritize tasks with tags or custom labels, and visually distinguish them with color coding.
    Calendar Integration: Add a calendar feature for task scheduling and visualizing deadlines. This can be synced with tasks to display due dates and milestones on the board.
